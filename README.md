## My process

This was a really interesting Challenge especially because of the JS part. Just like other challenges, i chose mobile first approach ðŸ“±. 

For the first time I faced some HTML challenges (choosing between form fields or just regular para/heading) but bigger than that was the JS part. The challenge for me was how to read values from the fields after user inputs the proper value (and not NaN). But I figured it out by using the "change" event listener on all input fields.ðŸ¤”

I also tried to make the page more accessible (ðŸ¤ž)
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learnt about more [Event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) & [Pesudo Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) (shoutout to MDN Docs for providing such great documentation ðŸ¤©)
- âœ… Learnt to declare all functions at top of Script


```html
<!-- I liked the forms in this one -->
<input class="input-field" type="number" name="number-people" id="people-count" placeholder="0" aria-label="enter-number-of-people" required aria-required="The number of people cannot be 0" min="0" max="100" />
```
